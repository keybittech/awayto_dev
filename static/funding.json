    "description": "Joe McCormick worked at the Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) Writing Center as a professional writing tutor and volunteer web developer, under the supervision of Writing Center Director Clint Gardner. Together they created an online tutoring platorm which allowed users to meet on a live, online space using voice, video, and text. This platform has facilitated tens of thousands of meetings with students at the school. Joe went on to receive a Masters from Durham University, England, in TESOL with a focus on Applied Language Studies. For his dissertation, he surveyed and studied writing centers and their ability to perform needs analysis on their tutees. Afterward, he worked as tech leader and director in various software development roles. Now, he develops an education and services-centric web framework entitled Awayto, which offers detailed documentation for developers, and a platform for organizations to offer services.",

    "description": "Awayto is for groups or organizations which require scheduling, communications, reporting, and related functionality. Collaborative multi-modal features (voice/video/chat/docs) are positioned within a robust collection of operations-driven functionality (users/groups/roles/services/scheduling/surveying/reporting). Many founding principles of the platform were derived from previous experience developing and extending an online writing center. However, Awayto is built to be generic-purpose and enable the development of any kind of online platform with multi-modal needs.",
