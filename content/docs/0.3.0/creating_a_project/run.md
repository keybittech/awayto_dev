### [&#128279;](#run-the-project) Run the Project

A GNU Makefile is the basis for building dependencies as well as taskrunning.

#### Build the project

```
make build
```

#### Run Docker containers

Docker is used for Keycloak, Redis, Postgres, Coturn, and Goetnberg.

```
make docker_up
```

#### Develop the landing site

The landing is a static website generated by Hugo. 

```
make landing_dev
```

#### Develop the app front end

The app front end uses a Vite dev server serving a React-based application.

```
make ts_dev
```

#### Develop the app back end

The server is a standalone Go module built into a binary then run locally. It serves: the front end static build folder (or dev server), a reverse proxy to Keycloak, an API backed by Postgres, a WebSocket server, and other essentials.

```
make go_dev
```

If the ts_dev server is already running, the go_dev server will proxy that for local development, instead of the front end static build folder.

#### Visit the site

Access the project at [https://localhost:7443](https://localhost:7443).
